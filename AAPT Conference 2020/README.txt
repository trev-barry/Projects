ABOUT

This material includes a presentation that I presented at the 2020 American Association of Physics Teachers conference with my research partner River Ward.

This project was an analysis of students growth during an introductory physics laboratory course. The students were given four open-ended questions to test their literacy in several core physics concepts surrounding averages, spread and measuring uncertainty. We categorized these open responses and mapped these students conceptual growth across two semesters.

Through our research we found that when students were asked to choose between two difference datasets with the same mean, we found that around 40% of students gave the same answer at the beginning of the semester as the end.
