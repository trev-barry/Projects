ABOUT

This is an article myself and my research partner wrote for The Physics Teacher magazine. This project was a continuation of research done for the 2020 American Association of Physics Teachers conference. This research focused on a longitudinal analysis of two introductory physics laboratory courses taken in succession. These students progress surrounding concepts like measurement uncertainty were tracked using a multiple choice test given at the start and end of each semester. These choices paired with open responses were mapped across the semesters.
